  |  6	|  Lists and Keys	|  Build a "Todo List" app where users can add and display tasks. |
  |  7	|  Styling in React (CSS, inline styles)	|  Style the "Todo List" app using CSS or a library like Bootstrap. |

## Week 2: React Hooks and Advanced Components
-  Objective: Master React hooks and build dynamic components.

    | Day          | Topic         | Project Idea   |
    |   :---:      |     :---      |     :---      |
    |  8	|  useEffect Hook	  |  Build a "Digital Clock" that updates every second. |
    |  9	|  Forms in React (Controlled Components)	  |   Create a "Contact Form" with fields for name, email, and message. |
    |  10 |  Form Validation	|  Add validation to the "Contact Form" (e.g., required fields, email format). |
    |  11 |  React Router (Basic Routing)	  |  Build a "Multi-Page Blog" app with Home, About, and Blog pages. |
    |  12 |	Nested Routes and Dynamic Routing	  |   Add a "Post Details" page to the Blog app that displays individual posts. |
    |  13 |	Context API (Global State Management)	  |  Create a "Theme Toggler" app (light/dark mode) using Context API. |
    |  14 |	Reusable Components	  |  Build a "Modal" component that can be reused across the app. |

## Week 3: API Integration and State Management
-  Objective: Learn to fetch data from APIs and manage complex state.

    | Day          | Topic         | Project Idea   |
    |   :---:      |     :---      |     :---      |
    | 15	|  Fetching Data with fetch or axios	| Build a "Weather App" that fetches and displays weather data from an API. |
    | 16	  |  Loading and Error States	|  Add a loading spinner and error message to the "Weather App". |
    | 17	|  Lifting State Up	  |  Create a "Currency Converter" app that converts between currencies. |
    | 18	|  Introduction to Redux (Optional)	  |  Build a "Shopping Cart" app using Redux for state management. |
    | 19	|  Memoization (React.memo, useMemo)	|  Optimize the "Shopping Cart" app to prevent unnecessary re-renders. |
    | 20	|  Code Splitting and Lazy Loading	|  Lazy load the "Post Details" page in the Blog app. |
    | 21	|  Error Boundaries  |  	Add an error boundary to catch errors in the "Weather App". |

## Week 4: Advanced Topics and Final Project
-  Objective: Explore advanced React concepts and build a complete project.

    | Day          | Topic         | Project Idea   |
    |   :---:      |     :---      |     :---      |
    | 22	  |  Introduction to TypeScript with React	|  Convert the "Todo List" app to use TypeScript. |
    | 23	  |  Testing React Components (Jest, React Testing Library)	|  Write unit tests for the "Counter" app. |
    | 24	  |  Performance Optimization	  |  Optimize the "Weather App" using useMemo and useCallback. |
    | 25	  |  Deployment (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)	  |  Deploy the "Blog" app to a live platform.  |
    | 26-28	|  Final Project: E-commerce App	  |  Build an "E-commerce App" with product listing, cart, and checkout functionality. |
    | 29-30	|  Polish and Refactor Final Project	|  Add styling, responsiveness, and performance optimizations to the final project. |
